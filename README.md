# Module-1-Challenge Refactored
I was task with refactoring this web page. I refactored existing code by adding semantic HTML elements, making sure the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning, and adding accessible alt attributes to pictures.
I also made sure that the links all function correctly, CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure, and the CSS file is properly commented. Lastly, I made sure to leave the code a little cleaner than I found it.

## What's Included
Index.html File

Assets Folder with images

CSS folder containing stylesheet.css
